Boeing 747-400 747-400/200 sounds for FS98 A remix of some actual 747 sounds with special attention given to reducing the variation of sound levels and dropouts between the thrust levels to give a much smoother sounding feel throughout the thrust range. A better combination of heavey jet and fan whine is also achieved to give that feeling of flying a powerful aircraft. CLIVE MARRIOTT, SYDNEY AUSTRALIA.. File size 3934597
